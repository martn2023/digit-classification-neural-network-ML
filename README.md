# I. Author's context:
- I've held leadership roles in numerous VC-backed tech startups, but they were all __business__ roles (finance, COO, product). I'm a complete beginner when it comes to __Applied ML Engineering__.
 

- An ex-Google dev showed me an industry standard ML book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646) by Aurelien Geron. The foundational projects are:
