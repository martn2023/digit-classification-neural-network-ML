# I. Author's Context:
- I've held leadership roles in numerous VC-backed tech startups, but they were all __business__ roles (finance, COO, product). I'm a complete beginner when it comes to __Applied ML Engineering__.

- An ex-Google dev showed me an industry standard ML book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646) by Aurelien Geron:

# IV. Challenges, Tradeoffs and Considerations:
### Re-combine raw data?
MINST offers 70K images, but these are pre-split into 60K training and 10K testing. My kneejerk reaction was to combine these 2 and re-shuffle them to "simulate the real world", where there's no reasonable expectation of getting data curated for you at the start. I reluctantly withdrew my objection because doing would increase inconsistencies from a mountain of existing literature on this table-stakes exercise, and I didn't want to get stuck trying to figure out if any deltas were due to error vs the fact I recombined test data at the start.
